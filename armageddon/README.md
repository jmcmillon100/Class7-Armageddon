Armageddon

Purpose of Labs 1–3

Labs 1–3 are designed to change how you think about systems, not just what you can configure. Many students enter technical programs expecting clear instructions, immediate success, and confirmation at each step. These labs intentionally break that expectation. Real systems do not announce what is wrong, and they do not guide you toward the answer. Labs 1–3 are your first controlled exposure to that reality—while the consequences are still safe and recoverable.

Lab 1 introduces you to infrastructure as something you must reason about, not click through. You are asked to build, connect, and verify components using evidence rather than assumption. When something does not work, the goal is not speed—it is clarity. You learn to observe system behavior, read logs, and confirm what exists versus what you think exists. This lab establishes the habit of verifying before acting.

Lab 2 increases responsibility by adding exposure and enforcement. Now the systems you build are no longer isolated. Traffic paths, access controls, and external interfaces matter. You begin to see how small configuration decisions can have wider impact, and how security and reliability are not separate from infrastructure—they are properties of it. The discomfort here is intentional. It teaches you to slow down when the blast radius grows.

Lab 3 introduces real-world constraints that cannot be ignored or “engineered away.” Data location, regional boundaries, identity trust, and cross-environment communication are not optional considerations in professional environments. This lab shows you how systems must adapt to legal, operational, and organizational limits. You are learning to design within boundaries instead of fighting them.

Together, Labs 1–3 are not tests of intelligence—they are training in judgment. Feeling uncertain, frustrated, or slow does not mean you are failing. It means you are learning how real systems behave. These labs exist so that your first encounter with complexity happens here, where you can recover, reflect, and grow—rather than later, when the cost of mistakes is far higher.

What Is Expected in Labs 1–3

You are expected to read before you ask a question.... 

You are expected to feel uncertain at times.
These labs are not designed to give you immediate confirmation that you are “doing it right.” Real systems rarely do. Feeling unsure does not mean you lack ability—it means you are learning to operate without constant feedback. Part of the work is learning how to pause, observe, and reason instead of rushing.

You are expected to verify your work using evidence.
Assumptions are not enough. You will need to confirm what exists, how components are connected, and how traffic or access actually flows. This may involve reading logs, using command-line tools, or checking system state multiple times. The goal is not speed, but accuracy.

You are expected to move slowly when impact increases.
As labs progress, your systems will affect more components and have greater potential impact. You are expected to recognize this and adjust your behavior accordingly. Slowing down is not a sign of weakness—it is a sign of professional judgment.

You are expected to encounter problems you did not anticipate.
Instructions will not cover every scenario. When something breaks, your task is not to panic or immediately ask for the answer. Your task is to gather information, form a hypothesis, test it, and adjust. This is how professionals work when systems fail in the real world.

You are expected to ask questions—but not for shortcuts.
Questions that clarify understanding are encouraged. Questions that ask someone else to do the thinking for you are not. Learning to phrase good questions is part of the lab. Over time, you will notice that your questions become more precise and grounded in evidence.

You are expected to finish with understanding, not perfection.
A working system is valuable, but understanding why it works—or why it failed—is more important. Partial success with clear reasoning is better than blind success with no insight.

Most importantly, you are expected to persist.
These labs are not pass/fail tests of intelligence. They are training in endurance, attention, and judgment. If you stay engaged, reflect on what happens, and learn from each step, you are doing exactly what is expected.

What Is Not Expected in Labs 1–3

You are not expected to understand everything immediately.
These labs introduce systems that are intentionally larger than any single explanation. Confusion at the beginning is normal and expected. Understanding develops through interaction, not instant clarity.

You are not expected to finish quickly.
Speed is not a goal in these labs. Taking extra time to verify, re-read outputs, or pause and think is appropriate. Rushing usually increases mistakes and makes recovery harder.

You are not expected to memorize commands, syntax, or configurations.
The goal is not recall. The goal is knowing how to find out what is happening and how to confirm it. Reference material is allowed and encouraged.

You are not expected to avoid mistakes.
Mistakes are part of the learning process. These labs are designed so that mistakes can happen safely. What matters is how you respond: observe, diagnose, and adjust.

You are not expected to “know the right answer.”
In many cases, there is more than one valid approach. The lab evaluates your reasoning, not whether you followed a single hidden path. Explaining why you chose an approach matters more than the approach itself.

You are not expected to compare yourself to others.
Students progress at different speeds. Some will struggle early and stabilize later. Others will move quickly at first and then slow down. Comparison adds pressure without adding understanding.

You are not expected to be perfect.
Clean execution comes later. At this stage, thoughtful engagement and persistence are far more important than flawless results.

Who You Become After Labs 1–3 (and Why the Market Cares)

If you complete Labs 1–3 and already hold AWS Solutions Architect – Associate and Terraform Associate, you are no longer competing for entry-level IT roles. You are entering the market as someone who understands how real systems behave, not just how to follow instructions.

At this point, employers see you as someone who can:
    build infrastructure deliberately
    reason through failures calmly
    verify systems using evidence
    work with automation responsibly
    avoid common mistakes that cause outages

That combination is rare — and valuable.

Roles You Are Prepared For

These are realistic roles graduates qualify for at this stage:
| Job Title                                      | Why You’re Qualified                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud Engineer**                             | You can design, deploy, and verify cloud infrastructure |
| **Junior DevOps Engineer**                     | You understand pipelines, IaC, and failure recovery     |
| **Infrastructure Engineer**                    | You reason about systems instead of guessing            |
| **Platform Engineer (Junior)**                 | You think in components, dependencies, and blast radius |
| **Site Reliability Engineer (Entry / Junior)** | You are calm when systems misbehave                     |

You are not being hired to “know everything.”
You are being hired because you are safe to give responsibility to.

Expected Salary Ranges (US Market, Conservative)
With Labs 1–3 completed plus AWS SAA and Terraform Associate:

| Role Level                        | Typical Salary Range |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Entry Cloud / Infra Engineer      | **$90k – $115k**     |
| Cloud Engineer                    | **$105k – $135k**    |
| Junior DevOps / Platform Engineer | **$110k – $140k**    |


Many students will move upward quickly once employed because they:
    ask better questions
    make fewer high-impact mistakes
    require less supervision over time

Where You Sit in the Market

At this stage, you typically rank in the:
    65th–80th percentile of IT candidates overall
    75th–85th percentile among cloud-focused candidates

That means:
    you are no longer “average”
    you are no longer easily replaceable
    you have momentum

This is before identity specialization, Kubernetes, or advanced platforms.

What Employers Notice First
Hiring managers consistently notice that graduates:
    do not panic when something breaks
    verify instead of assuming
    explain problems clearly
    understand cause and effect
    respect change management

Those traits matter more than buzzwords.

The Long View

Labs 1–3 do not finish your journey — they reposition you.
They move you from:
    
    “Can you follow instructions?”
    to
    “Can we trust you with real systems?”

Everything that follows — identity, Kubernetes, enterprise platforms — builds on that foundation.
