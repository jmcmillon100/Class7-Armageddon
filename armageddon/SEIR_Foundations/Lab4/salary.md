1️⃣ What Jobs Are Students Prepared For in this lab?

“You are no longer being trained to operate systems.
You are being trained to be trusted with them.”

That’s the leap.

Assumptions
Students have:

AWS SAA and/or GCP PCA

Terraform Associate

Can independently perform Labs 1–4 (AWS + GCP + networking + compliance + incident response + AI-assisted reporting)

That combination is not entry-level anymore.

Important truth:
Labs 3–4 (compliance + audit defense + multi-cloud) are what push students out of “cert-only” territory.

Industries Where This Skill Set Is Especially Valuable
These students are not generic cloud engineers. They are strongest in:
    🏥 Healthcare / Medical Systems
    🏦 Finance / Banking / FinTech
    🛡️ Government / Defense Contractors
    📜 Insurance
    🌍 Global Enterprises with Regional Laws
    ☁️ Cloud Providers & MSPs (higher tier teams)

Why?
Because these industries care about:
    Compliance
    Auditability
    Data residency
    Incident defense
      -—not just “making it work.”

2️⃣ How Do These Students Compare to “Normal” IT Engineers?

Skill Comparison Table
| Area              | Typical IT Engineer        | Your Students (Labs 1–4)                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Cloud Knowledge   | Knows services             | Designs architectures                   |
| Cert Usage        | Certs = knowledge          | Certs = baseline                        |
| Terraform         | Can write resources        | Designs multi-state, pipeline-ready IaC |
| Networking        | Basic VPCs                 | TGW, BGP, IPSec, cross-cloud            |
| Multi-Cloud       | Rare                       | Comfortable and deliberate              |
| Compliance        | “Security team handles it” | Designs *for* compliance                |
| Incident Response | Reacts, checks dashboards  | Evidence-first, audit-ready             |
| AI Usage          | Experiments                | Controlled, governed, accountable       |
| Judgment          | Optimizes uptime           | Optimizes legality + trust              |
| Audit Readiness   | Avoids auditors            | Can defend architecture                 |


The Key Difference

Normal IT engineers ask:
“How do I fix this quickly?”

You are training engineers to ask:
“What is the correct, defensible, legal fix?”
That difference is why salaries diverge.

Where “Normal” IT Engineers Typically Sit

Most traditional IT roles:
    System Admin
    Helpdesk
    Jr Cloud Engineer
    Ops Technician

Typical salary ceiling (without growth):
    $70k – $110k
    Often regional
    Often replaceable
    Often tool-focused, not judgment-focused


Where Your Students Sit
Your students are being trained for:
    Decision-heavy roles
    Regulated environments
    High-trust positions
    Architectural ownership

That pushes them into:
    $130k+ conversations
    Remote-friendly roles
    Global companies
    Slower hiring cycles, but much higher quality jobs

Where You Actually Sit (Percentiles, Not Feelings)
    This is not how smart you feel.
    This is where you rank relative to the market.

We’ll compare you (Labs 1–4 + certs) against all working IT / cloud professionals, not against mythical LinkedIn gods.

Percentile Placement by Skill Area
🧠 Cloud Architecture (AWS/GCP)
    General IT population: 30–40th percentile
    Typical “cloud engineer” with certs only: ~50th percentile
    You (Labs 1–4): 75–85th percentile

Why:
    You design multi-region systems
    You reason about failure
    You understand why things are built, not just how

🌐 Networking (TGW, BGP, IPSec, Cross-Cloud)
    General IT population: 20–30th percentile
    Typical cloud engineer: 40–50th percentile
    You: 85–90th percentile

Reality check:
Most “cloud engineers”:
    have never touched BGP
    have never debugged VPN tunnels
    have never designed cross-cloud routing
  
You can do this and more.

📜 Compliance & Data Residency
    General IT population: ~10–20th percentile
    Typical cloud engineer: ~30–40th percentile
    You: 90–95th percentile

This is the rarest skill you’ve built.
Most engineers:
    avoid compliance
    misunderstand it
    actively design illegal architectures without knowing it

You can defend systems to auditors.

That alone puts you in a tiny slice of the market.

🚨 Incident Response (Evidence-First, Audit-Ready)
    General IT population: ~25–35th percentile
    Typical DevOps: ~50–60th percentile
    You: 80–90th percentile

Why:
    You don’t “panic fix”
    You collect evidence first
    You can explain your actions after the fact

Most engineers cannot do that under pressure.

🤖 Responsible AI Usage (Bedrock / Vertex + Human Override)
    General IT population: ~5–15th percentile
    Typical cloud engineer: ~25–35th percentile
    You: 85–90th percentile

Most people:
    play with AI
    demo AI
    misuse AI

You:
    constrain it
    govern it
    override it
    accept responsibility

That is enterprise-grade behavior.

Overall Market Position (Be Honest)
You are not:
    Top 1% global savant
    FAANG principal engineer
    Magical unicorn who knows everything

You are:
    Solidly in the upper quartile
    Often in the top 10–20% for regulated-cloud roles
    In a much smaller, higher-trust labor pool

If we had to compress it to one number:
    --> You are roughly in the 80–90th percentile for the jobs this class prepares you for.

That is not average.
That is not replaceable.
That is not “Waffle House energy.”

(And no disrespect to Waffle House — they operate under pressure too.)

Should You Quit and Work at Waffle House?

Let’s answer that honestly.
If you:
    hate learning
    hate responsibility
    hate ambiguity
    want clear scripts forever
→ yes, this is the wrong field.

But if you:
    ask “what’s the right thing to do?”
    slow down to avoid harm
    care about legality and trust
    feel uncomfortable making big decisions
→ you are exactly the kind of person this field needs.
