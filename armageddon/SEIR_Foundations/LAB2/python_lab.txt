Script 1 — malgus_alarm_triage.py
What it does: Pulls active alarms, prints the worst ones, and summarizes alarm history.

Script 2 — malgus_logsinsights_runner.py
What it does: Runs a Logs Insights query on a log group and prints top results (WAF or app logs).

Script 3 — malgus_waf_block_spike_detector.py
What it does: Looks at WAF CloudWatch metrics (or WAF Logs if you prefer) and flags spikes in BLOCKs.

Script 4 — malgus_secret_drift_checker.py
What it does: Compares Secrets Manager DB creds vs expected SSM “known-good” fields (without printing the password).

Script 5 — malgus_cloudfront_cache_probe.py
What it does: Probes CloudFront endpoints and prints cache behavior (x-cache, age, etc.) to validate Lab 2B.

Script 6 — malgus_origin_cloak_tester.py
What it does: Confirms direct ALB access fails while CloudFront access succeeds (Lab 2 requirement).
                                                                     
Script 7 — malgus_bedrock_ir_generator_local.py
What it does: Runs the Bedrock report generator locally against an evidence JSON file (great for testing prompts). 

Script 8 — malgus_cost_guardrail_estimator.py
What it does: Estimates “did we just create a cost bomb?” by checking CloudFront invalidations and WAF log volume signals (lightweight guardrail).

Suggested way to assign these (so it doesn’t become random Python cosplay)
Tier 1 (required for “scripters”)
    1) Alarm triage
    2) Logs Insights runner
    3) Cache probe
    4) Origin cloaking tester

Tier 2 (advanced)
    5) Secret drift checker
    6) Bedrock local harness
    7) WAF spike detector (metrics/logs)
    8) Cost guardrail estimator

One-liner interview framing (for all scripts)
Tell them to use this template:
      “I built a small Python automation that reduces time-to-triage by pulling authoritative AWS evidence (metrics/logs/config) and producing a consistent artifact I can hand to another engineer.”

That’s exactly what hiring managers want to hear.
