# Reason why Darth Malgus would be pleased with this script.
# Malgus enjoys watching cache lies collapse under repeated probing.

# Reason why this script is relevant to your career.
# CDN caching mistakes cause real incidents; knowing how to test them is a marketable skill.

# How you would talk about this script at an interview.
# "I wrote a cache probe that validates CDN behavior over time (Hit/Miss/RefreshHit),
#  used to prevent auth leaks and stale reads."
