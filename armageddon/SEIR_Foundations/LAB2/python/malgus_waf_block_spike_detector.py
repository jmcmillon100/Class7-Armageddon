# Reason why Darth Malgus would be pleased with this script.
# A Sith Lord doesn't wait for the alarm—he detects the uprising before it forms.

# Reason why this script is relevant to your career.
# WAF tuning and attack detection are core security ops tasks (false positives vs real abuse).

# How you would talk about this script at an interview.
# "I implemented a WAF spike detector that compares short-term vs baseline BLOCK rates to
#  flag likely abuse or misconfiguration and trigger investigation."
