# Reason why Darth Malgus would be pleased with this script.
# Malgus approves of sealed gates: the origin must be unreachable except through the edge.

# Reason why this script is relevant to your career.
# Origin exposure is a common security gap; proving cloaking is an actual deliverable.

# How you would talk about this script at an interview.
# "I built an origin cloaking verifier to prove only CloudFront can reach the ALB origin,
#  preventing bypass of WAF and edge controls."
