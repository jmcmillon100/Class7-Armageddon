What is my cache key for /api/* and why?
    The cache key for /api/* effectively disables caching by using a cache policy with TTL = 0. 
    This ensures CloudFront never reuses API responses, preventing stale reads and eliminating the risk of serving one user’s data to another. 
    Dynamic API responses must always be origin-driven unless explicitly proven safe to cache.

What am I forwarding to the origin and why?
    For /api/*, the origin request policy forwards only the headers, query strings, and cookies required by the application. 
    These values are forwarded to the origin but are not included in the cache key, avoiding cache fragmentation while still ensuring the origin receives all necessary request context.
